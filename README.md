All dates should be in format DD/MM/YYYY
For example, 17/12/2025, 23/06/2025

You can filter animals by all the attributes. I just didn't add it to CLI

If you use dunction DisplayKennels, you will see animals in kennels only on current date
Information for future reservations stores in bookings

If something don't work, I also added this to github:
